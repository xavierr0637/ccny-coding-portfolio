This wasthe most fun activity for me. Creating my own game and choosing my own adventuyre and being able to incoporate the things 
I enjoy into this game it was really enjoyable for me. Not only that i got to get a little bit more practice in with the strings and other methods
that we learned earlier in the semester. I struggled to get the game to run but I figured it out eventually it took a lot of time and effort but 
thats what data science causes. Not only that but I also struggled uploading this to github but I was also able to figure it out.
