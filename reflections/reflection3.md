This was probably the most difficult activity of them all but the most interesting activity as well. The reason for this is having to work
with Pandas and having to mount my drive. This one took the longest for me to do out of all of them because it was so much data and so much to
understand what is going on. Also the false data and understanding that duplicates may negatively effect data and multiples may also negatively effect
data. However it was really interesting to see how they viewed slaves back then and how they lied about how many slaves were on these ships and the percentages
compared to the male and female and children slaves.
