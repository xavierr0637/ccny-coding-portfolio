The activity in itself was not that bad I did struggle trying to figure out how to properly insert an interger and sometimes for me it is a lot to remember and as for setting up the gitub that was another thing I struggled with properly . another thing that I realized I messed up with was properly uploading the file to github and not just uploading it right from colab. I still struggle with terminology and the proper wording at things however one thing I can say is that I can properly point out a certain error if I see it I just can't always describe it. I think that as time goes on and the more and more I practice it it will get easier for me. I do know how to properly give something a name. I would like to practice more with floats as well.
