This was one of my fasvorite activites. I enjoyed making the lists and loops. This was very interesting for me because it forced me to understand the idea of
how miticuouls this is and how much we have to pay attention to what we do. For example if you forget to even put a quotation it can mess up the whole cell. 
This would just lead to continous issues if you aren't paying attention. However it was cool to see how lists come together and how you can pull
ceryain things and ideas and or topics from the list to an extent it allows me to undertsnad how intellegent python really is.
